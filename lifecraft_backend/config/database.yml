# PostgreSQL with PostGIS is needed. You should have the pg gem installed; if not,
# run `bundle install`. Afterwards, run `psql` and do:
# user=# CREATE DATABASE lifecraft;
# user=# CREATE DATABASE lifecraft_test;
# user=# \quit

development:
  adapter: postgresql
  database: lifecraft
  host: localhost

# Warning: The database defined as "test" will be erased and
# re-generated from your development database when you run "rake".
# Do not set this db to the same as development or production.
test:
  adapter: postgresql
  database: lifecraft_test
  host: localhost

production:
  adapter: postgresql
  database: lifecraft_prod
  host: localhost
